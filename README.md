# Rock vs Mine Prediction

## Overview
This project involves building a Logistic Regression model to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines. The dataset used consists of sonar signal readings, where the objective is to determine whether the signal is reflecting off a metallic mine or a natural rock.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains numerical attributes representing sonar signal frequencies.
- Each instance is labeled as either **Rock** or **Mine**.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load the dataset

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Describing the data get the statistical insights of data

3. **Model Training:**
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
   - Training logistic regression model on training data

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Accuracy on trainging data
   - Accuracy on test data

## Requirements
To run this notebook, install the following dependencies:
```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn 
```

## Results
- The trained model predicts whether a sonar signal corresponds to a rock or a mine.
- Performance metrics(accuracy) indicate how well the model generalizes.
